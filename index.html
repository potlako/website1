  <strong><u>Return & Exchange Policy</u></strong>
  <br>
  <p>
  <ol>
    <li>Items can be returned for an exchange/fix if reported within the first 24hrs of receiving the order.
      This applies to items that come with production defects such as cap size ,
      construction or colour/style not matching order description.</li>
    <li>
      Refunds are accepted however in the very extremely rare case where you received an incorrect order
      by mistake or if the reported defects of the wigs are not fixable & there isnâ€™t stock available for an exchange.
    </li>
    <li>To qualify for a return/refund the item must be unused and in the same condition and packaging you received it in.</li>
    <li>Kindly note that I do not offer refunds / style changes if you purchase an item and realise it does not suit
      you the way you expected.</li>
